# BoxPvP Template

This is a BoxPvP server template that I may or may not come back and update every so often, with new things I believe fit inside of the category of 'BoxPvP'.

Inside of this repository will be notations/comments throughout a few skripts that will help you understand how it may work and/or help you configurate it yourself.
Any attempts at contacting me with the intent of "How does this work?" or "Can you help me with ___" will be met with silence.

You are free to use anything uploaded to this repository, this entails, selling, re-uploading, any code in here.
All code is made by me (Nugg1ess), without the use of AI assistance.
