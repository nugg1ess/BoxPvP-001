[ INFORMATION ]

This is a BoxPvP server template I feel like making so I don't need to keep coming back and making new code every time.
You can take any code or all, everything is free for the taking, enjoy making a server for yourself.

I will provide zero help towards you or understand how anything works, you will find comments throughout some skripts
that can guide you how some things work, but that's it, I will not help you with any issues you have with my code.

Everything I make is tested and works on my conditions, if do not ask how to replicate, this is all on you. YOU.

You are the reason you opened this repository, you are the reason why you're still here, you are you, don't be different.

I give full permission to reupload, sell, any code in this repository.

This is all made in skript
