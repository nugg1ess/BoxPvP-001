[ INFORMATION ]

This is a BoxPvP server template I feel like making so I don't need to keep coming back and making new code every time.
You can take any code or all, everything is free for the taking, enjoy making a server for yourself.

I will provide zero help towards you or understand how anything works, you will find comments throughout some skripts
that can guide you how some things work, but that's it, I will not help you with any issues you have with my code.

Everything I make is tested and works on my conditions, if do not ask how to replicate, this is all on you. YOU.
I give full permission to reupload, sell, any code in this repository.

All files are made by me without the use of AI. 
(I cant believe I have to say this)
